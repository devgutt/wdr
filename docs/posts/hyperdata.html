            "A few days ago, I introduced WDR (Web Data Render) as a way to separate website data and presentation. The website page is a JSON with pure information (no markups). The rendering is made by the script at the bottom of the page.",
            "Because the website page is a valid JSON, it is really simple to get the information and reuse it for other purposes.",
            "To make it easy to get information from WDR websites, I'd like to introduce a new feature, available in the basic render today: **Hyperdata.**"

            "```{\n  \"local\": { \"#code\": \"42\" } \n}```",
            "You can check the source code of this page to see the `local.#code` key on the JSON.",
            "Now, I can show this information easily using the new **hyperdata** feature `\\{{ }}`:",
            "``` The code is \\{{ local.#code }}. ```",

            "I can reference any part of the JSON, just using the information path.",
            "But every page on a website in WDR is a valid JSON, so I can capture information of any page too.", 
            "Let’s do this by putting an URL in front of the JSON path:",

            "The information is always **fresh** and **up-to-date**. If the source website is updated, your page will show the same information.",

            "Because the JSON is pure data, it is very lightweight. All the rendering information is elegantly hidden when you capture the JSON.",
